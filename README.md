Practice 1— Using lists 

Sort the List and print the three descending values 

Given a list of countries as input, please sort the list in alphabetical order, then print out the first three values in descending order in the Output Panel. 

Note: Use this value for the List initialization: new List (of String) from {"Germany", "Spain", "Japan", "Brazil", "India", "China"}. 

Output: one entry in the Output panel containing a list with the three alphabetical descending items (“Spain, Japan, India”).

A few important things to consider:

Initialize a list with the data given at the start of the exercise. 
Use Invoke Method and Assign activities to manipulate the data in the list. 
Print the result to the Output Panel.
